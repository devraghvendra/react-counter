# Started learning React JS.

Learning new framework/language is always exciting. I've starting learning learning MERN and this is my first react day of learning React JS 
and here is my first react app.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
